1. Java program: copy a file from HDFS to LFS

 The Source path  is taken by copytolocal method from filesystem and destination path as its parameters which is taken from
arguments 
 output :1.The file "COPYFILE" has to be removed  by using -rm from local system and then checked it by listing the files
        2.Then executed my jar file "Hadoop jar copytolocal.jar" and then listed the localsystem by -ls then  my copyfile.txt is copied
    

2. Importance and usage of the below terms
● DFSInputStream ● DFSOutputStream ● FSDataInputStream ● FSDataOutputStream

FSDataOutputStream • 
Provides stream (channel) for writing data. Filesystem’s create () method return FSDataOutputStream, which use to
create new HDFS file or write the content at the EOF. It doesn’t provide seek because of HDFS limitation to write to content at the EOF
only. It wrap Java IO’s DataOutputStream and add method such as getPos() to get the position of the file and write() to write the content 
at the last position.

FSDataInputStream • 
The stream (channel) is provided for reading data. FSDataInputStream wraps the DataInputStream and implements Seekable, 
PositionedReadable interfaces which provide method like getPos(), seek() method to provide Random Access on HDFS file. . Below sample 
code uses seek (), getPos () and read() method FSDataInputStream also implements
PositionedReadable, which provide read, & readFully method to read part of file content from seek position as mentioned below read
(long position, byte[] buffer, int offset, int length) DFSInputStreamseek() method seek
the file to the given offset from the start of the file so that read () will stream from that location whereas getPos() method will return
the current position on the InputStream
• Handles communication of the namenode with various datanodes
• Called internally by FSDataInputStream..
• Manages data read activity in case of datanode failure. 

DFSOutputStream•
 The communication of the namenode are handles with various datanodes,so it is also Called internally by FSDataOutputStream.
